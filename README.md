# love2d_kungfu_master
retro kungfu master implementation with love2d

## regarding licenses
All the graphics images are copied from internet. I didn't create them at all.  
Once things settle down, I'll separate the game asset from this repo so that I can put MIT license on these codes.

## brief intro
I'm not a professional game developer so you can safely assume that all the codes and ideas here are pretty primitive.  
And this game will never be like the original. That's not my intention.  
I'm just interested in experimenting various ideas.  
And fortunatelly, there are many young talented/enthusiastic developers out there.  
I'd be just glad if this was used as a base for their further improvements. Good Luck

## some internal mechanisms
TBD
